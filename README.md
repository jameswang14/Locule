Locule
======

Android app created at ModevEast 2013 Hackathon. Still under development by me as a side project for eventual release on
the Google Play Store. 

Locule helps track appointments by using the Google Directions API. Locule periodically samples your location and calculates
the travel time to each of your appointments and notifies you when to leave.
